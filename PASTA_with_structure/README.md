# PASTA_with_structure
An on-going project; trying to extend PASTA so that it uses not only the primary sequences but also secondary structure of RNA (either as input from user or from SSU-align if the inputs are SSUs).
This is the repository for supportive codes and scripts for this project, mostly for studying purposes. Data is not supposed to be found here. A more thorough extension of PASTA (if it has a chance) will be put in another place.
